# 8vim_keyboard_layout_generator
Edit the script's first few line.
Run it and it'll create the new layout file for 8vim, along with showing the new variable to update in 8vim's code.

# Issue
I have kept the original esperanto keys just so others can see them. I haven't made it calculate the letters based on the new layout, because these special letters need manually adjusting anyway.
